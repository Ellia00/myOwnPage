                    Hello there! My name is Elliot. I'm 24 years old and recently finished my web development education. I'm a passionate developer with a curiosity for solving problems and creating beautiful, functional designs. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech, gaming, or diving into a good book. I love learning and am always seeking new ways to grow both personally and professionally.

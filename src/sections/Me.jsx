                    Hello there! My name is Elliot. I'm 24 years old and recently finished my web development education. I'm a passionate developer with a curiosity for solving problems and creating beautiful, functional designs. When Iâ€™m not coding, im either gaming, reading or exploring new tech. I love learning and I am always seeking new ways to grow both personally and professionally.
